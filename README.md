# Dotfiles

This repository has configuration dotfiles for Linux and macOS.

## Installation

Run `install_dotfiles.py`, which depends only on standard library modules available since Python 3.8. Specify the name of the program whose configuration should be installed, or specify the `--all` option to install everything.

## Other Configuration

Each folder has a README file to specify further instructions for configuring that program.
